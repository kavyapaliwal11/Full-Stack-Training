## üìù Overview

The **React-Dev-Practice** repository provides an environment to explore and apply React concepts such as components, state, props, hooks, routing, and API integration. Whether you are just starting with React or looking to enhance your skills, this repository will help you build a solid foundation.

This repository is perfect for :

- Frontend Developers
- Full-Stack Developers
- React Enthusiasts

You will find various projects focusing on building reusable components, implementing state management, and handling real-world application scenarios.

## ‚ö° React + Vite

This template uses **React** with **Vite**, which provides a minimal and fast setup with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules for code quality.

Currently, two official Vite plugins are available for React development:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

Vite ensures a faster development experience, especially with large projects, making it ideal for modern React applications.
